# Education For All

Education is a vital aspect of life, providing individuals with knowledge and skills to succeed in their personal and professional lives. It opens doors to better job opportunities, higher income, and improved quality of life. However, disabled individuals may face significant barriers to accessing the education they need to achieve their goals. With the rise of the digital age, educational institutions are increasingly relying on technology to deliver courses and materials, which can present challenges for disabled students who may struggle to access or use digital resources due to their disability. As a result, it's essential to ensure that education is inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of ability. This requires proactive measures to identify and remove barriers to access, such as providing assistive technology, alternative formats, and accessible course materials. By doing so, we can ensure that disabled individuals have the same opportunities to learn and grow as their non-disabled peers, allowing them to reach their full potential and contribute to society.


# Basic project idea

The idea of using eye blinks to convert digital signals for use in technology is an innovative and potentially game-changing concept. By detecting eye blinks and converting them into a code such as Morse code, we could use the resulting signals to control various aspects of technology. For example, we could use eye blinks to play or pause videos, seek specific parts of a video, or even control other devices such as a smart home system. This technology has the potential to be especially beneficial for individuals with disabilities, such as those who are paralyzed or have limited mobility. The application of this concept could also be extended to other domains, such as gaming or virtual reality, where it could potentially provide users with a more immersive and interactive experience.

1. Users gives input to some kind of sensor, camera in this case.
2. Data is passed into the backend system, if user is using their mobile phones then processing of passed data will happen on the mobile itself.
3. Data from the backend system is send to asynchrous system where we process the passed images and also keep looking at any other parameter which might affect the flow of information.
4. We will also store the data (past data) in our low traffic databases which will be mainly accessed to understand the patterns of user.
5. The output of the processed information is passed to the a high traffic DB, which would be listened by multiple other devices.
6. The information stored in the high traffic databases will be scanned continuously by devices.
7. Based on the information passed, actions will be taken to update information.
